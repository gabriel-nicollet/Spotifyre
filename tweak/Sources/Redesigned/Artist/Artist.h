// The artist redesign: Spotify's artist page kept, with its list and its controls, decluttered and given the
// header the playlist and album pages have, so the three read as one app.
//
// The page is TemplateKit's TemplateView, id=creator-page (trees/clean/artist/01.txt:26, recorded
// 2026-09-16), not the album's CreativeWorkTemplateView: its header is an ImageHeaderView, the photo, the
// name, the listeners and a row of explore, follow, more, shuffle and play, which Spotify shrinks to a 100pt
// bar pinned at the top as the page scrolls; under it a strip of Music / Video / Merch tabs, each a list.
//
//     ArtistField.x     the photo's field behind the whole page, the page kept clear on it, the tab strip
//                       gone (the Music list is the page), the flags the screen forces
//     ArtistHeader.x    the header: the photo full bleed dissolving into the field, and the Kit's
//                       SGRHeaderInfo over it -- the name, the listeners, shuffle, a white Play and Follow
//     ArtistSections.x  the sections the Music list carries that are not the artist's music: its videos, and
//                       the Artist pick, the Release Countdown and About when asked
//     ArtistFollow.x    whether the artist is followed, from Spotify's collection, for Follow's glyph
//     ArtistSettings.m  the Artists page of Mod Settings: the switches below
//
// Every hook installs only while Redesigned UI is on (SGRedesignedUI); the native look's do not then.
// Threading: main thread only.
